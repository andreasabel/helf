A Lambda Term Representation Based on Ordered Linear Logic 

We introduce a nameless representation of lambda terms based on
ordered logic.  Information about number and places of variables bound
by a lambda is available without examining the whole term, thus making
it possible to drop unneeded substitutions early to avoid memory
leaks.

We describe an implementation of this and other representations as
well as suggested evaluation algotithms. These implementations were
tested in Haskell by using them for typechecking large dependently
typed terms of the logical framework (LF).  The different needs of
time and space are documented and compared.
